			AWAKEN!

			Something or someone is coming. I can feel it...

			It is nearly time...

			Are you ready to use your powers to fight them?

			You have to find the Amulet of the Goddess and defeat them before it is too late!
		
			They're coming for me and for you... I must go for now...

			Goodbye and good luck on your quest. 

			By the way, make sure you keep an eye on the transmissions because I will be talking through anybody who posts through there... 

			Also, somewhere on this page, there is an invisible link which will lead you to the discovery of your own powers...

			Goodbye 

		-->
