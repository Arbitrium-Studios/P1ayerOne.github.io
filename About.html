		<center><img src="assets/img/AboutOmni.png" alt="About Omniversal!" class="Omni" style="color: #C8A2C8"></center>
		<center><p style="color: #C8A2C8">Omniversal is Zachary Danielson's own company that he wants to have go big, like way up there with Google, Amazon, and the bunch except better than them.</p></center>
		<br>
		<center><p style="color: #C8A2C8">What he means by that is that he wants to create his own video games, movies, search engine (maybe), publishing service, and everything, hence the part of the name "Omni". Everything will be less corrupt and if he discovers that they're becoming corrupt, he swears he will turn his company into a non-profit company and fire the corrupt employees as quickly as possible!</p></center>
